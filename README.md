# Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Sight-Word-Millionaire
Inspiration
As a former school teacher, I wish I had technologies such as this. However, a former colleage reached out to me and asked me if I could
create a sight word game for her class. I enjoy working on any project, free or paid, because it allows me to sharpen my coding skills.
I enjoyed the process of creating this project and am thankful to the many resources I was able to learn from. In this game the player
is presented with an incomplete sentence. They are given four selections, and must select the correct sight word. If they get stuck, they
can use the 50/50 lifeline, poll, or phone-a-friend.
